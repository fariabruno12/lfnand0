### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Luiz Fernando, I'm from Brazil, and I'm currently in college studying Computer Science (PUC Minas).
- I speak both English and Portuguese fluently
- Though I'm rather familiarized with programming overall, I still don't have one specific language I can safely say I'm great at it - which is a good thing, since it's what keeps me studying and searching for more information.
- My first contact with programming was when I was only 12 years old, through both Arduino and Scratch, and since then I grew to love it more and more.
