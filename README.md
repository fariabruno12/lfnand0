My name is Luiz Fernando, I'm from Brazil, and I'm currently in college studying Computer Science (PUC Minas). Though I would consider myself rather familiarized with programming overall, I still don't have one specific language I can safely say I'm great at - which is a good thing, since it's what keeps me studying daily and searching for more information. My first contact with programming was when I was only 12 years old, through both Arduino and Scratch, and since then I grew to love it more and more. Cool fact about me: I speak both English and Portuguese fluently!

Skills: Javascript / Python / C / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ I want to learn ReactJS, Node.JS, C++ and C# in the near future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python and C++ 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love databending images, and I also spend way too much time listening to music on a day-to-day basis.
